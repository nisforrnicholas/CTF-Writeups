**How many services are running under port 1000?**

Running a basic (only top 1000 ports) nmap scan, I obtained the following results:

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot1.png">

No of services running under port 1000: **2**

<br>

**What is running on the higher port?**

**ssh**

<br>

**What's the CVE you're using against the application?** 

At first, I was trying to see if there was any exploit associated with the ftp server running on port 21. (**vsftpd 3.0.3**) However, I had no luck finding a good exploit to use.

Fortunately, my gobuster scan (which I had running earlier) revealed that there was a directory called "**simple**"!

Navigating to the directory on my web browser, I can see the following webpage:

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot3.png">

Seems like a default **CMS MADE SIMPLE** page! CMS Made Simple is a free, open source content management system to provide developers, programmers and site owners a web-based development and administration area.

Scrolling down the page, I found out that the server is running **CMS Made Simple Version 2.2.8**.

With that, I can try finding an appropriate exploit!

<br>

Using **Searchsploit**, I obtained the following exploits:

Based on the version we found out, the only possible exploit we can use is:

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot6.png">

To find out the CVE number, we can use the following command in Searchsploit!

```
searchsploit php/webapps/46635.py --examine
```

Result:

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot7.png">

CVE we are using against the application: **CVE-2019-9053**

<br>

**To what kind of vulnerability is the application vulnerable?**

**sqli** (sql injection)

<br>

**What's the password?**

Before I ran the exploit, I tried to understand how it worked first. 

From what I could gather, the exploit worked by achieving unauthenticated blind time-based SQL injection through the m1_idlist parameter with the news module.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot8.png">

This is a good example of how blind sql injections work. I believe that the exploit works the same way.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot9.png">

<br>

Hence, by injecting certain sql commands into the m1_idlist parameter, the exploit can obtain information like the users, password hashes and even emails from the server!

<br>

Base url *(options.url is the input by the user)*

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot10.png">

SQL injection payload

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot11.png">

The entire process is repeated, with changing input from a dictionary of the different characters.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot12.png">

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot13.png">

It repeats the SQL injection, checking for the response to determine whether the bit inputted is correct, before forming the final result. In this case, the final result being the username!

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot14.png">

This logic applies for finding the passwords and emails.

After running the exploit, I obtained the username and password!

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot15.png">

However, it seems that the password found is not actually the password, but a hash (md5 hash based on research). Hence, I will use the password cracker that comes with the exploit (nifty) to try and crack the password!

Unfortunately, I experienced a lot of issues with the password-cracking portion of the exploit. I could not seem to get it workingâ€¦ Fortunately, after reading some write ups, I found that I can use **hashcat** to do the decoding for us. The command used will be:

```
hashcat -a 0 -m 20 0c01f4468bd75d7a84c7eb73846e8d96:1dac0d92e9fa6bb2 /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt
```

**notes:**

**-a sets the attack mode. In this case, mode 0 = straight mode**

**-m sets the hash format. In this case, format 20 = md5(salt.pass)**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot16.png">

IMPORTANT:

**Even though we know that the salt prepends the password, in hashcat, the way we enter the salt & password combo must be**: **hash:salt  (not salt:hash)**

Password: **secret**

<br>

**Where can you login with the details obtained?**

First, I made sure to check the ftp server first. Since anonymous login is enabled, I should not require a password to enter.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot19.png">

After entering the server, I could see nothing of interest. Hence, the next logical place to check would be the ssh server running at port **2222.**

It turns out that we can login into **ssh.**

<br>

**What's the user flag?**

After logging into the ssh server (using -p to specify port 2222), I could easily retrieve the user.txt.

<br>

**Is there any other user in the home directory? What's its name?**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot21.png">

Other user: **sunbath**

<br>

**What can you leverage to spawn a privileged shell?**

Checking my sudo privileges with '**sudo -l**', I can see that **vim** is the program that I can leverage to spawn a privileged shell. This is because I know that we can spawn shells within vim/vi.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot22.png">

<br>

**What's the root flag?**

First, we open up vim with sudo enabled.

Then, we press '**esc**' to activate command mode, before typing '**:sh**' to open up a shell.

<br>

We got root! :smile:
