Many of the writeups that I wrote in 2020 have been rewritten as I was not satisfied with how I wrote them after revisiting them. I was still a complete noob back then so there were quite a lot of things that I didn't really understand, and it really showed in my writing. 

I'll leave the original writeups here, but the rewritten writeups can be found at https://nisforrnicholas.github.io
